# HAP-Sharp
## Net bridge for HomeKit Accessory Server  

### Overview

 HapSharp it’s a .net bridge to allow you expose our awesome .net world into HomeKit protocol.

### Requisites

First of all you will need to configure your environment, I created a simple script to do it automagically for you

    make configure

If you want execute the current configured host, you can do it from VSforMac/VS or from a terminal window with:

    make run

### How it works

Because we want re-use years of work and investigation from the community, my work it’s based in HAP-NodeJS project https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS .

Basically, our .net data structure generates the node-js “accessory” code required by HAP-NodeJS which is the protagonist of all communication with HomeKit protocol.

The generated NodeJS accessory files are prepared to establish MQTT communication with our .Net Bridge converting this MQTT calls into .net calls event based.

### Accessories

Right now, in this prototype there are 4 type of accessories to include in your host:

* BridgedCore: This an special accessory can host other Accessories “behind”. This way we can simply publish the Bridge (with a simple HAPServer on a single port) and all bridged Accessories will be hosted automatically, instead of needed to publish every single Accessory as a serpare server (this is not implemented yet).


Right now, we use this way to load all accessories created because it’s the easiest way. In the future this will be more customisable.

* Light: This accessory exposes the behaviour of a single light, with 2 states: On/Off

* Light with Brightness: Same like simple light but adds a regulable brightness bar

* Temperature sensor: It allows handle the temperature in a specific timeout sending the calculated values to HomeKit.


### The Host

The little boy who has the logic to make all this things possible is the Host. 

In order of execution it’s the responsible of:

1. Run and manage a clean environment
2. Generates all native accessory code
3. Keeps alive the current .net session
4. Management HAP-NodeJS sessions …  

### In Code

The host is represented by HapSession class which has 3 steps

Instanciate

```
var session = new HapSession();
```

Add all message delegates and accessories you want

```
 session.Add(new CustomBridgedCoreMessageDelegate(
      new CustomBridgedCoreAccessory("NetAwesomeBridge", "22:32:43:54:65:14")
 ));
```

Start the session

```
session.Start ([Your HAP-NodeJS path], [your Broker MQTT address for communication]);
```

At this point your defined message handlers and accessories are loaded and your host knows all the necessary things to execute your HomeKit accessory hosting. 

As we talked before, this process will kill any other running process in memory, before start the session to be sure your port is not busy. 

Note: If you are experiencing issues executing, check the Troubleshooting section

After this, all native accessories will be cleaned in the HAP-NodeJS embedded project (remember you specified the path) and the host will generate the necessary native files in the corresponding folder.

The console output will inform you about what’s happening and if something goes wrong.

The host finishes session, closes communications and stops processes calling to Stop() method or Dispose.


## Troubleshooting

* Your port is bussy with some instance of HAP-NodeJS zombie

Open Mac Terminal:

```
sudo lsof -iTCP:51826 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

* Extra logging

```
    var session = new HapSession() { Debug = True };
```
